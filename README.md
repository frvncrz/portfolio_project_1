1st Portfolio project from codecademy

Simple JavaScript project based on random quotes. I chose to do quotes on three shows: SpongeBob, Naruto, and Fullmetal Alchemist.

This was a fun project that I might revist later on to add some functionality when connected to an html file.


Thanks for viewing! - Fran
